Schematic 5.1
<br/>

Schematic 5.1 shows the circuitory to read voltage across variable resistor R15. Voltage across R15 will be varies betweeen $V_{CC}$, 5V and 0V. <br/>
R14 acts as current limiter to pin RA0 thus the voltage will be varies between 5V - $(R14 \times{} I_{R14})$ and 0V. Any small error will be corrected in code to achieve desired accuracy.
