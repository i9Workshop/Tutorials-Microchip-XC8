In this tutorial, DC brush motor will be used as example to control rotation speed by using PWM. 
DC brush motor uses very high power than MCU thus a driver circuit is needed to control direction and speed. 
Saperate the circuitory adds the advantage which protects the MCU from damage if fault occurs at driver circuit.
