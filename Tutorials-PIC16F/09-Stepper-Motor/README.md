Bipolar stepper motor has a stator drived by two coil. Hence, a driver which can control two DC motor is needed to drive a bipolar stepper motor. Refer to motor and driver specification for voltage and current rating.

Diagram 9.1

Diagram 9.1 on the right is a simplified model of stepper motor using a single magnet pole for a $90^\circ$ full step rotation. The actual stepper motor has many magnet pole and coil to make a very small step. The typical wire arrangment respective to the coil windings is in Diagram 9.1 on the left.
