Bipolar stepper motor is a bruhless motor which has a stator drived by two set of coils. Hence, a driver which can control two DC motor is needed to drive a two selenoids. Refer to motor and driver specification for voltage and current rating.

Diagram 9.1

Diagram 9.1 on the right is a simplified model of stepper motor using a single magnet pole as rotor for a $90^\circ$ full step rotation. 
The actual stepper motor has many magnet pole on the rotor and multiple coil to make a very small step. The typical wires arrangment respective to the coil windings is in Diagram 9.1 on the left.
<br/>

Rotation of actual stepper motor needs squencial coil activation to move the rotor. There can be three mode of steps which are.
* Single-phase step, activation of one coil at one time.
  >$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow \overline{A} \rightarrow \overline{B}$
* Half step,
* >$$
